Is your code clean?
</li>

<li>
First, select your file (make sure it is in Java code format), then clean it with me!
</li>

It was a academic project where not only the person who did the project should be familiar with all the rules of clean code, but also know how to work with the file and analyze it well.

  I hope that by sharing this project, I have helped you in these areas. â™¥
